    content: `It was a clear and humid evening, the mist was just starting to rise from the pond. The old weimar woke and yawned and rose, stretching his backbone by walking forward with only his front feet until his joints cracked. He came over to me and bumped my Kindle with his nose and laid his chin on my knee. He looked up at me with large, expectant eyes and I knew… It was 7:45 PM. 

Watson is a thoughtful and caring dog. He worries about the young catfish in the pond. Every evening just before 8:00, he gets my attention and when I say "Let's go feed the catfish." He hops back, drops his head, bows his neck, and starts jumping like a frisky colt. I go to the garage, fill a can with floating catfish food, arm myself with a sharp garden hoe and head outdoors. Gladys picks up her walking stick and comes outside with Watson where she meets Waddy, the terrier mix. We start our evening stroll to the pond, following a mowed path. At the stock gate, Watson waits while Waddy the terrier jumps between the barbed wire strands as Gladys and I bring up the rear. Emmie the Shih Tzu decided to stay home where she usually spends her time licking her toes, the furniture, and the carpet. 

Feeding the catfish is interesting. The fish can feel or hear us walking up and know that it's feeding time. The little bluegill, brim and minnows are in the shallows waiting and facing the shore. The catfish are circling just a little farther out. I toss a handful of food to the small fish and they explode into action to get what they can before the catfish and turtles come in. I toss the rest of the food farther out and the waiting catfish make the water boil. 

I suggest to Gladys that we should walk with the dogs across the dam to see if any wood duck eggs are in the duck house. All we have to do is say to the dogs, "Let's go," and they are off. We proceed across the dam and indeed, there are six eggs in the duck house. It will be the second batch of the wood duck season. The sunset is brilliant and it is time to head back to the house. I shout to the dogs and they are off like race horses from a starting gate. Enroute and well ahead of Gladys and me, Waddy, the wise, outdoor country dog spots something moving in the tall grass north of us near the cow pen and goes to investigate. Watson the Weimaraner, the city bred, the tenderfoot, the "huntin' dawg" follows and sees Waddy pointing at something from what is a safe distance. Watson charges in and starts alternately pointing, charging and jumping in close to what Waddy is staying back from. I wonder if they have found a snake and move forward with my garden hoe. A small, black and white object makes a run for the cow pen with Watson in hot pursuit. Gladys and I shout, whistle and try to get Watson's attention. The skunk gets away and Watson rolls in the grass. He trots back to us with a big "huntin' dawg" grin on his face. At that point his life was probably in danger from either Gladys or me but we restrained ourselves and told him to go "to the house!" We catch up and find that he does, indeed, stink. Luckily for him and for us he only received a small shot from the skunk and not the full load. We (the corporate "We", meaning mostly Gladys) scrub him down with a mixture of peroxide and detergent using rubber gloves and a long-handled scrub brush. He spent a lonely night by himself in the laundry room. 

Next morning he was turned loose in the house again thanks to a light spraying from the skunk and quick action by Gladys in getting the anti-skunk wash ready so fast. Gladys is a tough country gal raised on a ranch in the Texas Panhandle and handles herself well around varmints. What a nice, intimate evening on the eve of Fathers Day at the intersection on Squirrel Road of Dog and Skunk.

I almost got holy on him,
but by then he’d forgiven in tears.
I, too, finally felt it,
the last to have Fred’s laced hands
around my neck as I carried
his precious body back
to his hospital bed that afternoon.

Next morning
the phone call
as I breakfasted:
“You’d better get over here.”

I went for one last look,
pressed down on his still warm chest,
surprising me with an exhalation,
comfort to my grieving hands.

“You did it,”
I told him.
He’d died well,
had made us brothers
make up.

I walked to the kitchen,
couldn’t wedge enough glazed donuts
in my mouth,
for the hunger.`

    content:`The heavy urn jostled against the seatbelt as Andrew backed out of the parking stall reserved for veterinarian clients. He’d prepared for this moment in all the ways they tell you to; fill your pet’s final day with their favourite activities, bring their most cherished toys to the appointment, write down what you want to say as the sedatives take hold. What they fail to mention is that, once your pet is gone, that bone-shaped chew toy they were listlessly gnawing in their final moments becomes a talisman of despair. That the words on that tear-stained scrap of paper in your pocket leave a painful, unerasable imprint on your heart. Would he ever emerge from this abyss of grief?
    
    Andrew shifted into drive and navigated to the exit of the plaza’s parking lot. He was terrified by the feelings roiling inside of him. As a clinical counsellor, he was accustomed to putting aside his own thoughts and concerns to make room for the heaps of empathy his job required. This was like stepping behind the curtain; sitting on the other side of the desk, so to speak.

    He turned right onto a thoroughfare and drove towards home. His eyes welled with tears and the road blurred to an amalgam of greys, yellows, and whites. Images of Jessie, his trusty brown lab, flashed through his mind. Her goofy smile, her pink tongue drooping from the side of her jowl. Her sleek body curled into a tight knot on her bed after a long day at the beach. With her love of the water, Andrew had always assumed she’d been a fish in a previous life.
    
    He made another right turn onto a quiet, tree-lined avenue. He decided to take the long way home, a last-ditch effort to delay the inevitable. Right now, in his back yard, was a gaping hole in the flower bed lining the east side of his property. A mound of fresh soil was piled next to it, a shovel laying prone on the lawn. The mosaic headstone his mother had made leaned against a wooden banister by the deck.

Jessie had been a free spirit, wild and untameable. Suddenly, the burial plan felt all wrong. Cloistering her within the confines of his back yard for the rest of eternity felt ruthless and inappropriate. Why had he ever even considered it?

His mind careened off in a hundred directions as the panic set in. Without consciously deciding to, he turned onto the oceanfront boulevard, joining the procession of vehicles meandering down the road. The sun hung low in the summer sky, its orange glow spayed across the surface of the sea. Andrew started to relax a little as he took in the scene.

He jolted forward to a grinding crunch, his chest slamming into the steering wheel. The urn launched out of its seatbelt and off the passenger seat. Its ceramic body smashed into the dash, shattering to bits. The plastic baggie holding Jessie’s ashes landed in the dirty footwell, flecks of grey coating the carpet.

Andrew looked ahead at the burly man stepping out of the vehicle he’d just rear-ended. He was completely stunned, his hands glued to the steering wheel. The man approached the driver’s side window, fuming.

“What the hell, buddy!” he shouted, waving his arms in the air.

Andrew rolled down his window. “I… I’m so sorry… my dog died,” he said, bursting into uncontrollable sobs.

The man lowered his hands, his face softening. “Well, I’m sorry to hear that. But you gotta be more careful.”

Andrew gave the man his business card and his insurance information, then pulled off into one of the angled parking stalls lining the promenade. He looked down in dismay at the mess on the floor of his car. Miraculously, most of the ashes had stayed in the baggie, but the urn was unsalvageable.

He bent down and brushed some of the escaped ash back into the baggie. Gripping it carefully, he sat up and opened the driver’s side door. He stepped out of the car, slamming the door shut with his foot. He crossed the promenade and hopped down onto the beach, cradling the baggie in both hands. Hot sand filled the spaces between the toes of his sandaled feet.

As he reached the shoreline, he heaved a great sigh and upended the baggie. The ashes fell anticlimactically into the water, settling onto the shallow seabed. The anxiety that had been twisting inside of him dissipated to a warm contentment. There was no doubt in his mind: this is what Jessie would have wanted.

As he turned back, Andrew watched a young golden retriever plunge into the ocean, chasing after a tennis ball his owner had tossed into the blue depths. He watched the dog frolic in the water and started to laugh.`

  was where to have lunch. We had

  you worried about everything
  from war in the Middle East
  to ISIS to sepsis to asteroids
  to your daughter's histrionic personality disorder
  to climate change to trolls. Please pass
  the arugula salad, I said.
  There was a brief pause then
  as you watched me pile lettuce, pine nuts,
  cherry tomatoes, slices of ripe avocado
  onto my plate. Then you resumed worrying
  about the polar bears, the deficit, the flu,
  North Korea, China, Russia, nuclear
  winter, while I stared out the window
  of a fine restaurant in a glass city in summer
  in the third decade of the 21st century,
  and chewed.`
