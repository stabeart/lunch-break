          <p className="text-xl">The heavy urn jostled against the seatbelt as Andrew backed out of the parking stall reserved for 
veterinarian clients. He’d prepared for this moment in all the ways they tell you to; fill your pet’s 
final day with their favourite activities, bring their most cherished toys to the appointment, write 
down what you want to say as the sedatives take hold. And yet, he felt completely helpless under 
the crushing weight of his grief. <br></br><br></br>
Andrew shifted into drive and navigated to the exit of the plaza’s parking lot. He was terrified by 
the feelings roiling inside of him. As a clinical counsellor, he was accustomed to putting aside 
his own thoughts and concerns to make room for the heaps of empathy his job required. This was 
like stepping behind the curtain; sitting on the other side of the desk, so to speak. 
He turned right onto a thoroughfare and drove towards home. His eyes welled with tears and the 
road blurred to an amalgam of greys, yellows, and whites. Images of Jessie, his trusty brown lab, 
flashed through his mind. Her goofy smile, her pink tongue drooping from the side of her jowl. 
Her sleek body curled into a tight knot on her bed after a long day at the beach. With her love of 
the water, Andrew had always assumed she’d been a fish in a previous life.
He made another right turn onto a quiet, tree-lined avenue. He decided to take the long way 
home, a last-ditch effort to delay the inevitable. Right now, in his back yard, was a gaping hole in 
the flower bed lining the east side of his property. A mound of fresh soil was piled next to it, a 
shovel laying prone on the lawn. The mosaic headstone his mother had made leaned against a 
wooden banister by the deck.
